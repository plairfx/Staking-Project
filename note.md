# Thoughts

- Right now we have created a very simple project, that will allow users to stake, without checking double checking if th eearn functions work as a expected,
ic an say most of it is down, but the most crucial point of the project is still not optimal yet, the rewards distrubtion, how is that going to work? i wonder.


# 11 June
- Setup minting/burn function when the xToken is used, instead of transfering etc..
- Think about the reward system, how do we want to implement this change to make it so everything will be shared Equally? 
-  WHat do we want to achieve with this?
-  


Als het even beter bekijken, we moet een manier vinden  om staking rondes te maken omdat right now is het op een onlogische manier 7200?
Wat gebeurd er wnr meerdere mensen claim proberen te spenden?





# Simplify everything, i have no desire to make it as robust as possible, but i still want to complete it.



# WE hae introduced a keeper, which will call the function every day around the same time, which will distrubute it to users.

Now we need to test it, but i think we should test it on the testnet.

nice :D
